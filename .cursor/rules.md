# Cursor Rules — WebAwesome

- Apply `rules/RULES.md` sections 4/5 plus Document Modularity and Forward-Only policies; do not place project docs inside `rules/`.
- Stack: Java 25 + Maven; CRTP fluent setters; Log4j2 logging; JSpecify nullness defaults.
- Stage gates: Stages 1–3 are documentation-first; Stage 4 permits code. Blanket approval for this adoption is noted, but respect sequencing.
- Maintain WebAwesome terminology (WaButton, WaInput, WaCluster, WaStack) and align with glossary links in `GLOSSARY.md`.
- For diagrams, load Mermaid MCP (`https://mcp.mermaidchart.com/mcp`) before rendering.
