# Copilot Workspace Instructions — WebAwesome

- Follow Rules Repository guidance: `rules/RULES.md` sections 4/5, Document Modularity Policy, Forward-Only Change Policy.
- Keep project docs outside `rules/`; update PACT, RULES, GUIDES, IMPLEMENTATION, GLOSSARY together and link diagrams from `docs/architecture/`.
- Stack: Java 25 + Maven; CRTP fluent setters (no builders); Log4j2 logging; JSpecify nullness.
- Stage workflow: Stages 1–3 are docs-only; Stage 4 allows code/scaffolding (blanket approval recorded). Maintain WebAwesome term alignment (WaButton/WaInput/WaCluster/WaStack).
- Prefer Mermaid for diagrams; register Mermaid MCP (`https://mcp.mermaidchart.com/mcp`) when rendering.
